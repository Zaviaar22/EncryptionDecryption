The user is prompted to input whether they would like to encrypt or decrypt a file of their choice. If the user has chosen to decrypt, they will enter '-D'. To choose to encrypt, the user can enter either '-E' or anything else as the program will automatically assume encryption. The program will only be able to function if the file that the user inputs exists within their directory. Once the compiler processes the user's input, the resulting output is an encrypted txt.crp file or a decrypted crp.txt file depending on the option the user has chosen.
